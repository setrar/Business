"Ladies and gentlemen,

Thank you for joining today's financial overview. Letâ€™s delve into our latest quarterly figures and key financial indicators that highlight our strategic trajectory and operational efficiency.

Firstly, our retained earnings the last quarters have shown a robust increase, reflecting our solid profitability and prudent financial management. We retained close to 30 million, supporting our strategic investments and growth initiatives. Dividends paid out this quarter amounted a close 2 million, maintaining a rewarding yield for our shareholders. Additionally, our supplier credits have increased, but still enhances our purchasing power and somewhat reflects our strong relationships with vendors.

Moving to our financial key indicators, our gross profit margin has remained stable at 25%, demonstrating our ability to manage production costs effectively. Our net profit margin has seen a slight improvement to 18%, indicative of our operational efficiencies and stringent cost control measures.

Concerning our liquidity ratios, the current ratio stands at a healthy 1.5, signaling our ability to cover short-term obligations. The quick ratio, an even stricter measure, is at 1.2, which underscores our strong liquidity position without reliance on inventory.

Finally, comparing our projected versus actual financial metrics over the last quarters, we have consistently met or exceeded most of our financial targets. This quarter, however, while our revenue projections were slightly overestimated, we managed to maintain profitability through cost savings and operational adjustments.

In summary, our financial health is strong, and our strategic initiatives are paying off. We are well-positioned to navigate future challenges and seize growth opportunities.

Thank you for your continued trust and support."
